# CV

A quick Ruby on Rails demo.

## Background

I'm an experienced Rails developer, but for a variety of reasons most of my projects are not open source. Therefore I created this small application to demonstrate that yeah, I actually know how to use Rails. It surely isn't the most versatile application and doesn't cover all Rails features, but it'll do its job. Besides, feature requests are warmly welcome :-).
